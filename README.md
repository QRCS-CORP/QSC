# QSC: Quantum Secure Cryptographic Solutions Library

**A compact, self-contained, and highly optimized post-quantum secure cryptographic library written in C.**

[View full documentation online](https://qrcs-corp.github.io/QSC/)


## Overview

QSC is designed to provide next-generation, post-quantum secure cryptographic primitives for applications requiring long-term security. Adhering to MISRA secure coding standards, the library is structured for clarity, ease of verification, and seamless integration into secure communications platforms. The code is well structured, thoroughly commented, and comes with an extensive testing platform covering every primitive contained in the library.


## Status

QSC is a compact and self-contained library written in C. It has been developed to meet MISRA secure coding standards and is designed to be easy to read, verify, and implement. The library incorporates next-generation asymmetric and symmetric primitives with a strong emphasis on true long-term security. It forms the basis for future integration efforts as a compact, high-security, post-quantum secure communications platform.

This implementation uses both a base reference code and optimized AVX/AVX2/AVX512 intrinsics for maximum performance. For best results, set your project properties to utilize the highest available SIMD instruction set supported by your CPUâ€”AVX-512 instructions are fully supported and offer the best performance profile.
